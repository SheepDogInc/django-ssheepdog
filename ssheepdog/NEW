Things we did that are innovative in this app:
(1) Use of ssh api from fabric
    - took a bit of time to figure out how best to configure output options
    - had to monkey patch ssh app to accept a private key as a
      StringIO in place of a filename (hacky)

(2) Instead of fabric's way, wrote capture_output:

    with capture_output() as captured:
      run(command)
    captured.stderr and captured.stdout now contain the output.

(3) DirtyFieldsMixin class:
class UserProfile(DirtyFieldsMixin, models.Model):
    ...
    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if 'ssh_key' in self.get_dirty_fields():
            Login.objects.filter(users___profile_cache=self).update(is_dirty=True)

(4) flagtest decorator:
    @flag_test('requires_vagrant')
    def test_connect(self):
        ...

  in settings,
    SKIP_TESTS_WITH_FLAGS = ['requires_vagrant', 'slow']

(5) Use of Twitter Bootstrap

(6) Use of a trick to get all the login-user pairs in one query:

    # To conserve DB queries, pre load all relations as a dict
    # {(3,4): True} means user w/ 3 can access login w/ id 4
    rel_list = Login.users.through.objects.values("user_id", "login_id")
    user_login_rel = dict([((x['user_id'], x['login_id']), True) for x in rel_list])
